<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
  This privacy policy (&quot;Policy&quot;) describes how Website Operator (&quot;Website Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
  &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal
  Information&quot;) you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) may provide on the
  <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://vypxl.io">vypxl.io</a>
  website and any of its products or services (collectively, &quot;Website&quot; or &quot;Services&quot;).
</p>
<p>
  It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access
  and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control,
  or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.
</p>
<h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
<p>
  When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include
  information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language
  preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the
  time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
  information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
  identify any particular user of the system.
</p>
<p>
  The collection of information is done via Google Analytics. You can find their Terms of Service
  <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
<p>
  You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify
  you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website's features, you will be
  asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any
  information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information
  may include personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
</p>
<p>
  You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
  some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.
</p>
<h2>Storing personal information</h2>
<p>
  We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations,
  resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may
  use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not
  in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be
  deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data
  portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.
</p>
<h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
<p>
  In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use
  certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you
  with the requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Website.
  However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources. Any of the information we collect from
  you may be used for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve user experience</li>
  <li>Run and operate our Website and Services</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website, where you are located in the world
  and if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes. This, however,
  does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or
  European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you
  and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
  obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest
  or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
  interests pursued by us or by a third party.
</p>
<p>
  Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by
  opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will
  be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision
  of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a
  contract.
</p>
<h2>Information transfer and storage</h2>
<p>
  Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other
  than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the
  European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more
  countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information. If any such
  transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with us
  using the information provided in the contact section.
</p>
<h2>The rights of users</h2>
<p>
  You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do
  the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the
  processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information if the
  processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if information is
  being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the
  information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it
  to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your
  information, in which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have
  the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the
  right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically
  feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided
  that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract
  which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
</p>
<h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
<p>
  Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us
  or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground
  related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your Personal
  Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without
  providing any justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes,
  you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.
</p>

<p>
  Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to Website Operator through the contact details provided in this

  year). To obtain this information please contact us.
